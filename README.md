# twinpeaksgematria
Little repository where you can look at some twin peaks gematria. 
I MADE AN ONLINE CALC FORGET THIS PROJECT:
https://www.tegcalc.com/

Take a look at the output csv file in microsoft excel or google sheets. Make sure to highlight duplicates to easily find "collisions".

Couple cool things to note:

-Carrie Page's english Gematria is the same as Laura Palmer's Hebrew Gematria. 

-Same relationship can be drawn between "Coffee" and "Odessa" which is neat because at the end of season 2 Laura is in a cup of coffee.

-Terms related to "Owls" "Muffin" have a lot of collisions, so when laura says she is the muffin, it's like she is saying she is an owl. I assume it's the screeching owl associated with Ishtar/Lilith. 

-There's lots more in there. Look up Sarah Palmer/Sarah Novack.
